## Smart City  Escalator Speed and Metro Transit Time Model Model - Class Diagram


The class diagram below provides a overview of the major classes contained within the system. Experimental conditions will be set within the escalator class and will be related to the other components of the model. The two independent variables that can be manipulated here are escalator speed and height. Subway rider density and train frequency will be determined by real world subway data.

Subway riders (referred to here as "pedestrians") logs experimental data, and this object will transition between the lower plate, steps, and upper plate.
